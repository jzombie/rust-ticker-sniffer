Palantir
: Cramer praised the software company’s management and said the company’s third quarter, which sent shares surging 20%, was one of the best of the year. He also said he liked the company’s defense business, noting Palantir’s work for the Pentagon.

Axon
: Axon largely makes equipment for law enforcement, and Cramer suggested it is poised to do well as a GOP trifecta in Washington likely means police will receive more funding. The company also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, and it has new software that includes artificial intelligence, he added.


EXPECTED: PLTR
EXPECTED: AXON
